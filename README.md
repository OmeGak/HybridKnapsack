HybridKnapsack is a hybrid approach to solve the knapsack problem cooperatively with several metaheuristics. Here there are implemented three algorithms:
* Local search.
* Tabu search.
* Simulated annealing.

This project is part of an assignment for the SH1 class of the Master in Soft Computing at University of Granada, Spain, and only for training purposes.
